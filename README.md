# -Image-Caption-Generator-model-
a simple Image Caption Generator model using TensorFlow and Keras
This repository contains the code for an Image Caption Generator, an AI-based project that uses deep learning techniques to automatically generate captions for images. The model architecture consists of a pre-trained VGG16 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for feature extraction from images, and an LSTM-based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for generating captions based on the extracted features.

The code is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras, and it can be easily extended to work with different datasets, such as the COCO dataset or Flickr8k dataset.

Key Features:

Pre-trained VGG16 model for efficient feature extraction
LSTM-based RNN for caption generation
Customizable model architecture and hyperparameters
Compatible with various image-caption datasets
Simple and easy-to-understand code
To use this code, preprocess your dataset (images and captions), split it into training and validation sets, and train the model using the provided code. You can adjust the hyperparameters and model architecture as needed to improve the performance of your Image Caption Generator.
